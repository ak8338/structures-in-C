Structures in C
This is a program that:
Defines a structure using typedef. The structure should have an integer as a member and a 50-character array for holding a string. Asks the user how many of these structures are needed. Using malloc, create storage for those number of structures.  Fills the structures with a number and a string using scanf. In a function, prints out the contents of the structures.
